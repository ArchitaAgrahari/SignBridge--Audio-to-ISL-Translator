# SignBridge: Audio-to-ISL Translator
 SignBridge is an innovative application designed to empower individuals with hearing and speech impairments by translating spoken language into Indian Sign Language (ISL). The system leverages real-time audio processing to display corresponding ISL gestures visually, either through animations or letter images.
